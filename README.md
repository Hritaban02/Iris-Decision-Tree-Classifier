# Iris-Decision-Tree-Classifier
Using Decision Tree Classification Algorithm to built a prediction model for Iris dataset. Each entry of the Iris dataset specifies a flower's Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width.

Note : The criterion used in the decision tree classifier algorithm is '**entropy**'.

Note : The dataset has been standardised and thus in the visualization of the decision tree some values may be negative.

Here's a peek into what the tree looks like...

Note: Due to the decision tree algorithm being non-deterministic, a different tree may be produced each time the algorithm is run.

Evaluation of the model is also done using a test set(Seperated out at the beginning from the dataset).
